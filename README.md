## How it was built

Pet Locator is a cutting-edge decentralized application (dApp) meticulously crafted using Next.js, a powerful React framework known for its performance and flexibility. Leveraging Next.js, Pet Locator ensures a seamless user experience with fast page loads and smooth navigation.

Underpinning Pet Locator's robust data management is Tableland, a SQL datastore renowned for its reliability and scalability. Tableland efficiently stores and organizes pet information, user data, and contact details, enabling quick access and retrieval when needed.

For image storage, Pet Locator harnesses the decentralized storage capabilities of Fleek on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). Fleek's integration with IPFS ensures that pet photos and other media are securely stored in a distributed network, guaranteeing data integrity and availability.

Pet Locator integrates with Filecoin EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) for executing smart contracts. Filecoin EVM provides a reliable and secure environment for deploying and executing smart contracts, enabling functionalities such as pet registration, ownership verification, and reward distribution for finders.

To facilitate seamless communication between users, Pet Locator adopts Push Protocol for video calling and messaging features. Push Protocol ensures real-time communication with low latency, enabling users to initiate video calls and exchange messages effortlessly, strengthening the bond between pet owners and finders.

Through this sophisticated tech stack, Pet Locator delivers a comprehensive solution for pet owners, providing peace of mind and efficient means of reuniting lost pets with their loving caregivers.
